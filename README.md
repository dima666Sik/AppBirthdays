### Project Structure

- This project uses jdk 11, JDBC API, MySQL Driver, GUI Java (Swing);
- The project is structured into several main packages:
    - `ui`: Contains the user interface components and logic.
    - `domain`: Includes the domain logic and models.
    - `dao`: Manages data access and database operations.
    - `main`: Consists of the Main class that serves as the program's entry point.
    - `models`: Contains shared models used across different layers;

### Launch guide

1. I would you recommended to clone my project from the GitHub.
   <br> If you wanna do this, please use this command:

```md  
git clone https://github.com/dima666Sik/AppBirthdays.git
```

2. To run this project you will need to install (or use docker images):
    - JDK 11 or higher;
    - MySQL RDBMS.

3. If you have downloaded a project and want to run it with your own database then you have to create enum which will be
   stored in a package `src/main/java/ua/birthdays/app/dao/env` and put your name tables please.

```java
public enum EnumDBNameTables {
    USER_TABLE("users"),
    USER_FRIENDS_DATA_TABLE("user_friends_data"),
    ABOUT_FRIEND_TABLE("about_friend"),
    FRIEND_BIRTHDAY_DATE_TABLE("friend_birthday_date");

    private final String enumDBEnvironment;

    EnumDBNameTables(String enumDBEnvironment) {
        this.enumDBEnvironment = enumDBEnvironment;
    }

    public String getEnumDBEnvironment() {
        return enumDBEnvironment;
    }
}
```

4. Also, please put your valid data in those properties. File stored in a `recourse` package.

```properties
# data for properties
app.birthdays.data.user.name=username
app.birthdays.data.password=password
app.birthdays.data.db.url=jdbc:RDBMS//host:port/nameDB
# name db
app.birthdays.data.db.name=namedb
```

5. Here are the steps for you to follow:
    - Add this project to your IDE as `Maven` project.
    - If necessary, configure `Java SDK 11` in `Project Structure settings`.
    - You can change setting to your logging into `log4j2.properties`.
    - First, you will need to register as a new user.

6. If you want to see documentation, please check javadoc in resources this app.
